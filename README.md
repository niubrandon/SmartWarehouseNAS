# SmartWarehouseNAS

Smart Warehouse applies Nebulas Blockchain technology to improve the transparency, reliability and efficiency of inventory transactions. 

Currently, there are 2 functions available:
* Manage inventory by adding (inbound) or removing (outbound) inventory to/from your physical storage. 
* Search for all transactions associated with a specific part number and show the remaining inventory balance (eg, P0001)
